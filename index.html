      <strong>Ancient Egyptians</strong> believed cats were magical creatures,
      capable of bringing good luck to the people who housed them. To honor
      these treasured pets, wealthy families dressed them in jewels and fed them
      treats fit for royalty. When the cats died, they were mummified. As a sign
      of mourning, the cat owners shaved off their eyebrows, and continued to
      mourn until their eyebrows grew back. Art from ancient Egypt shows statues
      and paintings of every type of feline. Cats were so special that those who
      killed them, even by accident, were sentenced to death.
